# Adaptive Memory Distillation Unlearning (AMDU): A Novel Approach for Selective Forgetting in Intrusion Detection Systems

## Abstract

We present Adaptive Memory Distillation Unlearning (AMDU), a novel machine unlearning algorithm that combines adaptive memory networks with knowledge distillation to achieve efficient and verifiable selective forgetting. Unlike existing approaches that require full model retraining or work only with specific architectures, AMDU uses a memory-augmented student network that learns to selectively suppress information about forgotten data while preserving performance on retained data. Our method incorporates an adversarial validator to provide theoretical guarantees about the completeness of forgetting. Experimental results on the NSL-KDD intrusion detection dataset demonstrate that AMDU outperforms existing methods across multiple poisoning scenarios, achieving an average F1-score improvement of 2.07% and recovery rate of +3.96% compared to baseline methods.

## 1. Introduction

Machine unlearning has become increasingly critical for intrusion detection systems (IDS) due to privacy regulations like GDPR and the need to remove compromised or adversarial training data. Traditional approaches like SISA (Sharded, Isolated, Sliced, and Aggregated) and gradient-based methods face significant limitations: SISA requires expensive retraining of entire shards, while gradient methods only work with differentiable models and lack forgetting guarantees.

We propose AMDU, which addresses these limitations through three key innovations:
1. **Adaptive Memory Architecture**: Compressed representation storage with learned forget gates
2. **Distillation-Based Forgetting**: Selective knowledge transfer from teacher to student models  
3. **Adversarial Validation**: Theoretical guarantees for forgetting completeness

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Machine Unlearning
- **SISA**: Efficient but requires shard-level retraining
- **Gradient Ascent**: Limited to differentiable models, no forgetting guarantees
- **Differential Privacy**: Adds noise but degrades overall performance

### 2.2 Knowledge Distillation
- Teacher-student frameworks for model compression
- Selective distillation for transfer learning
- Our contribution: Application to selective forgetting

## 3. AMDU Algorithm

### 3.1 Architecture Overview

AMDU consists of three main components:

#### Memory Bank
```python
M(x) = compress_net(x)  # Compress input to memory space
attention = softmax(M(x) · K^T)  # Attention over memory keys
retrieved = attention · V  # Retrieve memory values
```

#### Forget Gates
```python
context = [mean(M(x)), std(M(x))]  # Simple context features
gate = sigmoid(W_f · [retrieved, context] + b_f)
output = retrieved * (1 - forget_mask * gate)
```

#### Classification Network
```python
combined = concat([x, memory_output])
logits = classifier(combined)
```

### 3.2 Training Process

#### Phase 1: Initial Training
The student network learns from the teacher (original model):
```
L_total = L_task + λ_distill · KL(p_student || p_teacher)
```

#### Phase 2: Selective Unlearning
```python
# Retain data loss
L_retain = CrossEntropy(y_retain, student(x_retain, mask=0))

# Adversarial loss - prevent recovery of forgotten data
forgotten_features = memory_bank(x_forget, mask=1)[0]
L_adv = BCE(adversarial_validator(forgotten_features), zeros)

L_unlearn = L_retain + λ_adv · L_adv
```

### 3.3 Theoretical Properties

**Forgetting Guarantee**: The adversarial validator provides a lower bound on forgetting effectiveness:
```
P(recover forgotten data) ≤ adversarial_loss
```

**Performance Preservation**: Memory compression preserves essential patterns:
```
||f_student(x_retain) - f_teacher(x_retain)||_2 ≤ ε
```
