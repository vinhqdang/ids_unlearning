# Adaptive Memory Distillation Unlearning (AMDU) Algorithm Design

## Core Innovation

**AMDU** combines knowledge distillation with adaptive memory networks to achieve efficient, selective unlearning while maintaining model performance and theoretical guarantees.

## Key Innovations

### 1. **Adaptive Memory Architecture**
- **Memory Banks**: Store compressed representations of data patterns
- **Forget Gates**: Learned attention mechanisms that selectively suppress memory activations
- **Retention Boosters**: Amplify important patterns that should be preserved

### 2. **Distillation-Based Forgetting**
- **Teacher-Student Framework**: Original model teaches "clean" student model
- **Selective Distillation**: Only distill knowledge from non-forget data
- **Adversarial Regularization**: Ensure forgotten data cannot be recovered

### 3. **Dynamic Adaptation**
- **Online Learning**: Adapt to new forget requests without full retraining
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify and handle similar patterns efficiently
- **Performance Monitoring**: Automatically balance forgetting vs. retention

## Theoretical Foundations

### Memory Compression
```
M(x) = f_compress(x; θ_mem)
where M(x) represents compressed memory of input x
```

### Forget Gate Mechanism
```
F(x) = σ(W_f · [M(x), context(x)] + b_f)
where F(x) ∈ [0,1] controls memory activation
```

### Adaptive Loss Function
```
L_total = L_task + λ_forget · L_forget + λ_retain · L_retain + λ_adv · L_adversarial
```

## Algorithm Workflow

1. **Memory Encoding**: Compress training data into memory banks
2. **Forget Request Processing**: Generate forget masks for targeted removal
3. **Adaptive Distillation**: Train student model with selective knowledge transfer
4. **Adversarial Validation**: Ensure forgotten data is not recoverable
5. **Performance Validation**: Verify retained performance on clean data

## Advantages Over Existing Methods

- **Efficiency**: No need to retrain from scratch
- **Flexibility**: Works with any base model architecture
- **Guarantees**: Theoretical bounds on forgetting completeness
- **Adaptability**: Handles sequential forget requests efficiently
- **Robustness**: Maintains performance on retained data
